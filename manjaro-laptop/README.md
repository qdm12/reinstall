# Manjaro reinstall

This is for my laptop using Manjaro/Arch, mostly for coding.

## Script

```sh
cp script.sh ~/script.sh
chmod 500 ~/script.sh
sudo ~/script.sh
```

## TODOs

- Download files from Github when possible
- Use error trap to fail the script on any error
- Download welcome binary
- Use Dialog for interactive menus
- Auto login to Chromium and set it as default browser
- Login to Docker hub
- Generate wg0.conf with servers public keys and write client public key generated to desktop
- Git clone some projects
